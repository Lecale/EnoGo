# EnoGo
 Play Go like Brian Eno

 Go has existed for a long time, a much longer time than Brian Eno has existed. Yet time cannot describe the nature of the game, nor of the man. EnoGo takes Brian Eno, rendered in a simplified digital form, and filters his essence through artificial layers to engender you with the wisdom with which to take your decisions.
