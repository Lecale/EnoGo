A line has two sides
Abandon komi
Allow an easement (an easement is the abandonment of a stricture)
Be dirty
Breathe more deeply
Cascades
Cluster analysis
Consider the swan
Cut a vital connection
Define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor
Disconnect from desire
Emphasise the flaws
Fill every point with stone
Give the game away
Service unavailable
Go slowly all the way round the outside
Imagine the board as a moving chain or caterpillar
Imagine the stones as a set of disconnected events
Is it finished?
Is there something missing?
Is the joseki appropriate?
Just carry on
Listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly
Look at the order in which you do things
Look closely at the most embarrassing sequences and amplify them
Make a stone valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame
Make a sudden, destructive unpredictable action; incorporate
Overtly resist change
Put in earplugs
Remember those quiet moves
Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics
Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities
Repetition is a form of change
Reverse
Shut the door and put the cat outside
Switch off the TV
Take a break
Think of the radio
Tidy up
Trust in the ewe of Neu!
Turn it upside down twice over
Twist the spine
Use an unacceptable colour
Use fewer stones
Water
What is the reality of the situation?
What would Sai do?
You are in Grenoble
You can only make one move at a time
